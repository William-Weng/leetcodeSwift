init: for the single row, there are C(3, 3) * 3! = 6 3-color combinations, and C(3, 2) * 2 = 6 2-color combinations.
C(3, 3) * 3! means: choose 3 colors out of 3, and, first cell: 3 possibilities, second cell: 2 possibilities, third cell: only 1 possibility.
C(3, 2) * 2 means: choose 2 colors out of 3, and, there are only two ways: ABA or BAB.
